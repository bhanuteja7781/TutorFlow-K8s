# 🚀 Tutor Booking Platform

This repository demonstrates the transformation of a tutor booking application into a cloud-native, scalable system using modern DevOps practices.

> Note: The core application logic is developed separately. This repository focuses on containerization, CI/CD automation, and orchestration.

---

## 📖 Overview

Finding tutors on demand is challenging, and systems often fail to scale under real-time demand. This project focuses on how such an application can be deployed, managed, and scaled efficiently using DevOps methodologies.

The goal is to simulate a production-ready environment for a tutor booking platform.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Containerize the application using Docker  
- Implement CI/CD pipelines  
- Deploy and manage services using Kubernetes  
- Demonstrate scalability and reliability  
- Document DevOps workflows clearly  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

User → Frontend → Backend API → Database  
                         ↓  
                Notification Service  

---

## ⚙️ Services

- Frontend – User interface (optional in this repo)  
- Backend – Core application (Laravel)  
- Database – MySQL  
- Notification Service – Simulated microservice  

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup

Run locally using:

docker-compose up --build

Containers:
- backend  
- database  
- frontend (optional)  
- notification-service  

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

Implemented using GitHub Actions.

Workflow includes:
- Install dependencies  
- Run basic checks/tests  
- Build Docker images  
- Simulate deployment  

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes (Local Deployment)

Using Minikube:

minikube start  
kubectl apply -f k8s/

Demonstrations:
- Deployments  
- Services  
- Pod scaling  
- Rolling updates
